# You are working as an assistant for a billionaire who is an avid collector of Marvel action figures. There is a large auction for rare 
# figures coming up that the billionaire would like to attend, but she will be busy in meetings to discuss an upcoming merger so she decides 
# send you to the auction to make purchases on her behalf. She gives you a list of all n items that will appear in the auction along with 
# values quantifying how much each one is worth to her along with enough money to outbid anyone else in attendance (i.e. you donâ€™t have to 
# worry about how much the items will cost, only their values).

# When you get to the auction, you learn a few things about the format. First, you learn the order in which the action figures will be 
# presented. You also realize that each time you buy an item, you will have to fill out some paperwork to finalize your purchase. You will 
# be so busy with this paperwork, that you will not be able to purchase either of the next two items in the auction. Since you have plenty 
# of money, your job is to determine how to maximize the total value of the figures you purchase under this format.

# More formally, you are given a sequence of n items such that each item i has value vi and if you buy item j you can not buy items 
# j + 1 or j + 2. Your goal is to maximize the sum of the values of all the items purchased.

# Give an O(n) runtime algorithm to find a set of items fitting these criteria, prove the correctness of your algorithm, and analyze 
# its runtime.
